# Testimonials---Guide
We are collecting feedbacks from makers that did or organised a residency. 
In general, Vulca is trying to undestand how makers and hackers manage to be included in projects that allow them exchange and encourage mobility. From that point, Vulca will try to find the best and most optimal solution for both makers in mobility and creative spaces (fablabs, maker or hackerspaces) to organise a residency.
